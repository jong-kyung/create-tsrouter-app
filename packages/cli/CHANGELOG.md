# @tanstack/cli

## 0.71.0

### Minor Changes

- Add Gold partner deployment targets for Render and Vercel to React and Solid ([#507](https://github.com/TanStack/cli/pull/507))
  scaffolds. Render generates package-manager-aware Blueprint commands, while
  Vercel generates explicit framework detection and Nitro Build Output API
  support.

### Patch Changes

## 0.70.0

### Minor Changes

- Add a `--blank` project preset that creates a production-ready one-route app ([#488](https://github.com/TanStack/cli/pull/488))
  without starter UI, Tailwind, devtools, test tooling, Intent setup, or unused
  public assets. Pass `--intent` to opt local coding-agent skill mappings back in.
  Also move integration-specific dependencies to their owning add-ons and stop
  shipping an unused test stack in standard Start projects. Explicit styling and
  deployment add-ons remain composable with the blank preset, including when
  added later.

### Minor Changes

- feat(create): add React PowerSync scaffolding add-on ([#448](https://github.com/TanStack/cli/pull/448))

  `tanstack add powersync` (or `--add-ons powersync` on `tanstack create`)
  wires the PowerSync Web SDK into a React TanStack Start app:

  - `@powersync/web` + `@powersync/react` + `@journeyapps/wa-sqlite`
    dependencies and a Vite plugin that excludes `@powersync/web` from
    `optimizeDeps` and emits ES-module workers (required for the
    WA-SQLite VFS).
  - A `PowerSyncProvider` integration that opens a WA-SQLite database
    and connects with `disableSSRWarning` so SSR doesn't warn.
  - A sample `AppSchema` (todos table) and `BackendConnector` with
    `fetchCredentials` reading `VITE_POWERSYNC_URL` / `VITE_POWERSYNC_TOKEN`
    from `.env.local` and a stubbed `uploadData()` ready for the user's
    upstream write logic.
  - A `/demo/powersync` route that inserts rows locally and renders
    live `useQuery` results plus connection status, so the scaffold
    works zero-config and shows the SDK is wired up before any
    PowerSync instance is configured.

### Minor Changes

- feat(cli, create): add Shopify storefront add-on + storefront template ([`814d222`](https://github.com/TanStack/cli/commit/814d222ac04e839eabe56abce5dcbe66d751c5d8))

  Headless Shopify support for TanStack Start apps, scaffold-ready and
  runtime-portable. The pitch: prove that TanStack Start is a first-class
  target for Shopify, not just Next.js Commerce or Hydrogen.

  **`shopify` add-on** — additive. `tanstack add shopify` mounts `/shop/*`
  routes alongside an existing app without touching the home page. Includes:

  - Storefront API client (server-only fetch via `createServerFn`, public
    token by default + optional private token for higher rate limits and
    buyer-IP forwarding).
  - Hand-written GraphQL queries with hydrogen-react types (type-only;
    zero runtime weight).
  - httpOnly cookie cart (`tanstack_cart_id`) + React Query single-key
    cache + optimistic updates with module-level mutation counter to
    batch invalidations during rapid clicks.
  - Hydrogen-demo parity routes: shop landing, product detail (with
    variants + availability), collections, cart, search, Shopify CMS
    pages, policies.
  - Hydrogen-stock UI components (ProductCard, VariantSelector,
    AddToCartButton, CartLineItem, CartSummary, ShopImage with CDN
    transforms, Money via Intl) themed with six CSS custom properties
    for easy reskinning.
  - Header cart-count badge via the `header-user` integration slot.
  - Shopify-hosted checkout (redirect to `cart.checkoutUrl`).
  - **Optional Customer Account API** behind a `customerAccount` select
    option. Hand-rolled OAuth 2.1 PKCE with `.well-known` discovery
    cached in module memory (no usable npm client exists yet),
    HMAC-signed httpOnly session cookies (HS256), lazy token refresh,
    account dashboard / orders / order detail / addresses routes — all
    EJS-guarded so the files only emit when enabled.

  **`shopify-storefront` template** — storefront-first.
  `tanstack create my-shop --template shopify-storefront` cascades the
  `shopify` add-on (which cascades `tanstack-query`) and replaces the
  home route with a polished landing (hero + featured collections + best
  sellers grid).

  **Zero-config first run.** Defaults to Shopify's public Hydrogen demo
  store (`hydrogen-preview.myshopify.com`) so the storefront renders
  real products immediately. Override the four env vars in `.env.local`
  (or your deploy target's dashboard) to point at your store. Demo
  defaults are baked into source as fallbacks, so the experience doesn't
  break when a runtime doesn't load `.env` files into `process.env`.

  **Portable.** Cookie ops via `@tanstack/react-start/server`; crypto via
  Web Crypto (`crypto.subtle`); generic `CDN-Cache-Control` for browse
  (`s-maxage=300, stale-while-revalidate=600`) and `private, no-store`
  for cart. Works on Node, Cloudflare Workers, Shopify Oxygen (just
  Workers), Vercel, Netlify, Bun, Deno.

  **Header layout fix.** While the cart-count badge is the new
  right-aligned action, the base scaffold's `Header` was placing the
  social icons left-of-center on `sm+`. Reordered the JSX so navigation
  sits between the logo and the right-side actions in DOM order, with
  one mobile-only `order-3` to keep `flex-wrap` putting nav on its own
  row. Result: logo → nav → (auto-spaced) → cart/social/theme on every
  breakpoint, and a more sensible reading order for screen readers.

## 0.66.0

### Minor Changes

- feat(cli, create): close the gap between `tanstack create` and shipping a real app ([#445](https://github.com/TanStack/cli/pull/445))

  A bundle of UX improvements aimed at beginners (especially those coming from Next.js) and the AI agents they pair with:

  - **Tailored post-creation next steps.** The scaffold completion message now lists the env vars you still need to fill in `.env.local`, links the docs for each shipping-critical integration you picked (auth, database, ORM, deployment), and surfaces the Intent-wired AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md with concrete prompt examples.
  - **Pre-creation review screen.** After interactive prompts, the CLI shows a categorized summary (auth, database, ORM, deploy, other) and asks for confirmation before writing files. Conflicting selections (two auth providers, two ORMs, etc.) are flagged in the same step.
  - **`.env.example` generation.** A checked-in `.env.example` is now derived from the env-var schemas of selected add-ons, with descriptions and a `(required)` marker. Plays nicely with add-ons that ship their own `_dot_env.example.append`.
  - **Better add-on descriptions.** Concept-first one-liners replace generic "Add X to your application." Reads like a menu instead of a list of brand names.
  - **Deployment quickstarts.** Each `--deployment` host (Netlify, Cloudflare, Railway, Nitro) now contributes its own README section explaining the actual steps to ship — push, dashboard URL, env var sync.
  - **Clerk demo route parity.** Clerk's scaffold now ships a proper sign-in flow (matching Better Auth's depth) using Clerk's prebuilt components, plus a richer README with route-protection patterns and a production checklist.
  - **Intent install passes `--map`.** The auto-invoked `intent install` now writes explicit task→skill mappings into the agent config instead of relying on runtime discovery, so agents see directly which skill matches which task.
  - **`tanstack clean-demos` command.** A new subcommand removes leftover `demo.*` and `example.*` files (and prunes empty `routes/demo`/`routes/example` directories) so a beginner can ship without the scaffold's training wheels.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [[`83ebd17`](https://github.com/TanStack/cli/commit/83ebd172c2f6d5006b6eae3a08a3b687a3d8f2ca)]:

## 0.65.0

### Minor Changes

- feat(cli): auto-install TanStack Intent during scaffolding ([#442](https://github.com/TanStack/cli/pull/442))

  `tanstack create` and `tanstack add` now run `npx @tanstack/intent install`
  after dependency installation, wiring up skill mappings for coding agents.
  The behavior is controlled by a new `--intent` / `--no-intent` flag (default
  on) and persists to `.cta.json` so subsequent `add` invocations honor the
  original choice. Failures are surfaced as warnings instead of aborting the
  scaffold.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [[`37e83fb`](https://github.com/TanStack/cli/commit/37e83fbf324c6d60da09a4f2f268f540c8687d5f)]:
  - @tanstack/create@0.64.0

## 0.64.6

### Patch Changes

- fix(cli): make add-on multiselect keyboard controls discoverable ([#441](https://github.com/TanStack/cli/pull/441))

  Users encountering the add-on multiselect prompt during `tanstack create`
  often didn't realize the entries are checkboxes (toggle with Space) and
  that the selection must be confirmed with Enter. The existing keyboard
  shortcuts note was only shown once per session and could appear before
  single-select prompts where it didn't apply. Now:

  - The "Keyboard Shortcuts" note is shown immediately above every
    multiselect prompt and is no longer shown before single-select prompts.
  - The multiselect message itself includes an inline `(Space to toggle,
Enter to confirm)` hint so the cue is inseparable from the prompt.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [[`e38729f`](https://github.com/TanStack/cli/commit/e38729fe0b6a16e8d34417d2334baf2b2db94942)]:
  - @tanstack/create@0.63.9

## 0.64.4

### Patch Changes

- fix(cli): require Node.js >=20 and surface a clear error on older runtimes ([#438](https://github.com/TanStack/cli/pull/438))

  Older Node versions (e.g. Node 16) lack `events.addAbortListener`, which is
  used transitively by the CLI. Running on those versions produced a cryptic
  `SyntaxError: ... does not provide an export named 'addAbortListener'` during
  module instantiation. Both packages now declare `engines.node: ">=20"` so
  package managers warn at install time, and the CLI bin performs an early
  runtime check that prints an actionable message before any modules load.

  Closes #433

## 0.64.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix interactive mode not prompting for all options. ([#435](https://github.com/TanStack/cli/pull/435))

  - Default to interactive mode. Previously, `tanstack create my-app` silently applied defaults for framework, deployment, and install. Opt out with `--yes` / `--non-interactive`.
  - Add framework selection prompt when the CLI supports multiple frameworks and no `--framework` flag is passed.
  - Add "install dependencies now?" prompt when `--no-install` is not passed.
  - Show deployment adapter prompt by default (previously required `showDeploymentOptions: true`).
  - Honor `forcedDeployment` as the default selection in the deployment prompt, so deprecated aliases keep a sensible default.
  - Preserve explicit `--add-ons` arrays instead of overwriting them with the interactive sentinel.

  Add CLI-native agent introspection commands (`libraries`, `doc`, `search-docs`, `ecosystem`) and JSON output for `create --list-add-ons` / `create --addon-details` so AI agents can rely on CLI commands directly.

### Patch Changes

- Make the default base starter minimal (Home + About) for React and Solid, and add a new `blog` template option for both frameworks. ([`f33f8d4`](https://github.com/TanStack/cli/commit/f33f8d4954d9ad6771871257a4e1e58feee9b34d))

### Minor Changes

- This release pulls together a large batch of improvements across the CLI and scaffolding engine since the last versioning pass. ([`154b25e`](https://github.com/TanStack/cli/commit/154b25eec9a13b9718c44cbed6cb3c8566f2fb11))

  - Modernizes and refreshes the generated React/Solid template experience, including updated starter content and stronger defaults.
  - Improves create flows with better option normalization, stronger guardrails around target directories, and clearer compatibility behavior in router-only mode.
  - Expands scaffolding ergonomics with examples toggles, improved add-on/config handling, and reliability fixes across package-manager and cross-platform paths.
  - Strengthens test and release confidence via e2e/release workflow hardening and broader smoke coverage.
  - Streamlines product surface area by removing the local `create-ui` package and `--ui` command paths from the CLI; visual setup now lives at `https://tanstack.com/builder`.
  - Cleans up docs and custom CLI examples to match the current terminal-first workflow and Builder guidance.

  - Add `tanstack add-on dev` to watch project files and continuously refresh `.add-on` outputs.
  - Rebuild `.add-on` assets and `add-on.json` automatically when source files change.
  - Document the new add-on development loop in the custom add-on guide.

- Improve scaffold customization and custom add-on authoring flow. ([`5fbf262`](https://github.com/TanStack/cli/commit/5fbf262fe3a0d070e6a78fa2f2a920b176b84480))

  - Add `--examples` / `--no-examples` support to include or omit demo/example pages during app creation.
  - Prompt for add-on-declared environment variables during interactive create and seed entered values into generated `.env.local`.
  - Ensure custom add-on/starter metadata consistently includes a `version`, with safe backfill for older metadata files.
  - Align bundled starter/example metadata and docs with current Start/file-router behavior.

- Updated dependencies [[`b3cc585`](https://github.com/TanStack/cli/commit/b3cc5851d2b81613e3b024eb7981c440ee5183af), [`5fbf262`](https://github.com/TanStack/cli/commit/5fbf262fe3a0d070e6a78fa2f2a920b176b84480)]:

## 0.59.6

### Patch Changes

- Improve CLI compatibility and scaffold behavior for legacy router-first workflows. ([`2949819`](https://github.com/TanStack/cli/commit/2949819058b4d4b1760be683ef29bfd459ddb28b))

  - Add safer target directory handling by warning before creating into non-empty folders.
  - Support explicit git initialization control via `--git` and `--no-git`.
  - Restore router-only compatibility mode with file-based routing templates (without Start-dependent add-ons/deployments/starters), while still allowing toolchains.
  - Default `create-tsrouter-app` to router-only compatibility mode.
